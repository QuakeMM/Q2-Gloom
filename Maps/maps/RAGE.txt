 Duty        : Over decades humans and spiders have been at war.
               The spiders and their countless army swarm the 
               humans. But, the humans withhold the technology to
               overcome these odds. In a last ditch effort, where 
               the surface of Koset has been raged of endless battles
               you are to take control of the planet. To do that you
               must rid the other of the Defence Compound located in
               Central City. The outcome of this battle will greatly 
               affect the outcome of the war.
