Map Info:	It's a remake of totalkarn. If you don't know what totalkarn is, you haven't been playing gloom
		long enough. In fact, you haven't been playing for much more than a day, since the damn map is
		played so much on onecall everyone knows it like the back of their hand. I tried to enhance both
		the visuals and the gameplay. Let me know what you think: cataclaw@sympatico.ca
