Map Pack 1
by Savvy
Revision: 2

==== Reasons for Savvy maps ====
smis.bsp - speed mission map contest between me and nobee at one time.
easerisland.bsp - 1 day ordeal for easter 2007 or 2008 i believe
savvy-betaX.bsp - urban sprawl
compind-bX.bsp - to show people i can actually make a map that isn't just squared off corners everywhere
cavern666-betaX.bsp - a simple map created with the intent of quick games
gdm4-beta1a.bsp - an attempt at merging basic techniques used in various maps - such as backway hallway mixed from mines-2, gloom, and spambox
enttibox-beta1.bsp - entti kept poking fun at how most of my maps use mostly square rooms and usually contain boxes to fill them up. i made this flood clone for him
amuse.bsp - an unfinnished attempt at creating an amusement park, really meant to be a carnival. My brushwork is both lacking and confusing. I may remake this later.
infapX.bsp - an unfinnished attempt at creating an infested airport, all custom crappy textures, this way it can be made standalone
