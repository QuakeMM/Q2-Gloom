So, what´s the point of making a special edition of a map that was made 3 1/2
years ago? Not much, but I always liked the first one and always wanted to
fix the serious flaws on it. So, enjoy!

NOTE! 2 earlier betaversions, named devastator-se.bsp and devastator-final.bsp
was released a few days/hours prior to this one.Please throw those to hell.
