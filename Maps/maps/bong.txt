(A Q2Gloom multi-mapper project, led by Cataclaw)
(Text file by Godmil)

-----------------------

Premise:

Cataclaw came up with the concept of getting a series of mappers
to each add a section to a map then passing it on to the next.
Starting with Cataclaw's centre room, each mapper added a section as it came to them,
with no predetermined plan, design or restriction, which makes for a pretty free flowing structure.
After a few days of constant expansion, some decisions were made on how to
tie the loose ends up in a few final sections.
