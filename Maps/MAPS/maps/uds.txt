	This map is dedicated to Jex, for our
		two year anniversary.

 This map has been created out of the ruins of other and smaller maps. I
 spent quite some time trying to keep this map playable, but due to the 
 nature of my map designs, computers who cannot handle the technology are
 out of luck. Some of you will probably think me a hypocrit, for having
 verbally shot down others' maps for the same reason, but unlike them, I
 never designed my map to be a playable map, but rather a work of art that
 just happens to be a map as well. I did put in effort so as not to make
 it too harsh, and as long as all doors are closed the r_speeds should 
 never rise much above a thousand in normal areas, to my knowledge. 


 Thanks to Jex, Godmil, GZ and the Tremulous team.
