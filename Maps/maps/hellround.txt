	This map is dedicated to Cyclops, Samedi, Oddjob and the other
		Thanks For Dying! heroes.

Dear Jesus, Buddah and Allah, please make the r-speeds low even though I crammed
this map with junk. Players will notice that there are no really, really high places for spawns.
We´re all thankful for that.
