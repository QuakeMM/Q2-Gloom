-----------------Features-----------------

This map is the first gloom map to include a key. Building classes are able to retrieve the key. Having done this the player with the key should try to hit the button in the opposing team's base to turn their 5 frag class "On" and turn the opposing team's "Off".
-------------------Misc-------------------

The alien base may seem a bit rushed because after a century of procrastinating, a HD crash, and most recently a power supply death... I finally decided just to finish it and never have to look at it again.
