Place this map in your drive:\quake2\baseq2\maps directory.

Tired of playing all the ugly maps that Gloom has become known for, I tried to something of better quality.  I think the results are pretty good.  Although admittidly its not the sexiest map on the planet, it certianlly, in my opinion, blows everything else out of the water.

E-mail me all you comments and suggestions, as with feedback, my maps can only get
better.  Thanks for the download.
