Thanks To:	-Gryt-	 Assorted stuff. Playtesting, awesome environment map. :D

		-Ankka - Helping me with optimizing the map, playtesting, i can almost say this map

		-Ghost - Providing me with the breeder texture. (That's him in the picture!)
	
		Anyone else i didn't mention!

		I'd also like to point out.. *** HOB SUCKS ***

Version info:
	v2.0	- Fixed a number of bugs.. added railing to the ramp in prison cell room. 
		  Revamped spider base. Upgraded human base. Optimized some areas by reducing r_speeds.
		  Added a new structure to outdoor area outside spider base. Added second entrance to human base.
		  Added a few evil... secrets :)
	v1.0	- Initial release

	
Map Info:	It's a prison. Play and have fun. Etc.

Known bugs: 	Some minor vis errors. You can see through the prison cell bars. There's nothing
		i could do about those, so just live with it :) The map at first glance might appear to be a bit
		human friendly with the overall brightness, but from playtesting the map, spiders actually
		win the map more than the humans, so i guess it all works out well. Enjoy :)
