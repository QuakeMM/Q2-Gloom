Mapname: Facility 29 - topside

E-Mail : bspit@planetquake.com


Build time: on and off for a long time

compile time: 30 minutes on an amd 1.0ghz/768MB ram.


Basic info : A simple gloom map. This map utilizes a subset of HFX textutes ( http://www.planetquake.com/hfx ) converted to PNG and WAL formats for use with most quake2 mods.Note the textures are property of hfx/Yves Allaire and you must credit him if you choose to use them. 

There has been some discussion reguarding the scale/layout. The map was intended for gloom use and as such theres room to jump and do battle. Doors are 128x128 and 256x256. Lots of places to build, 2 main entrances for each base. 

If there was a storyline I would say facility 29 is some sort of human cargo base and an illegal alien shipment um breaks out and chaos ensues. have fun!


gloom addnum - bases/starting pts are defined as follows:
  
  each team has 300 pts in turrets/spikers
  each team has 4 start spawns.
  each team has 4 gassers/detectors
  each team has 2 hlr/depot

Ps : Dont cry to me about every little texture or crate or shadow you see not perfectly aligned. Its decent for what it is, theres far worse out there.
