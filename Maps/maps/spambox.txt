Thanks To:	Gloom2, Totalkarn and especially Spacebase for inspiring me to make Spam Box.

	v1.0	- Initial release

	
Map Info:	So you're wondering what the f@$! this is. It's just a regular gloom map, perposely designed
		for hectic games. Think the choke point in gloom2 with spacebase all over and a touch of totalkarn.
		Why did i make this? If you'll check the GMD, you'll notice that i released on jan 13 (same release
		date as this map) Jam. It's a large map that took weeks of hard work. I was wondering if a small map,
		made in about 4 hours would be as popular or even more favored than the map that took weeks of work.
		I got this idea after i saw how rsm01f was quite a popular map on Onecall for some time, and it was
		nothing more than a damned speed map. Meanwhile my "real" maps, prison, garenab, etc. were never played
		and more or less hated by all. So this is a little experiment. Will this relatively crappy, small map
		outplay jam?



Useless copyright stuff:
Blah, blah, quake2 id software, blah blah, custom sounds, blah blah, don't do illegal stuff with this, blah blah.
