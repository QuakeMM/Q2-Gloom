About...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opeth is one of the best bands ever.
You haven't lived until you've listened to Opeth.
I was a skeptic at first. Death metal? What's that?
I was just another heavy metal, power metal, thrash metal
and symphonic metal fan - until i discovered a new subgenre.
In fact, Opeth should be a subgenre of it's own. Damn good
music...

Special thanks to the following people:

[PeSTiCiDE] - He's a huge Opeth fan and therefore kicks ass.
              Map was his idea and has him to thank for.
              He was also the one who introduced me to Opeth...

R1CH	    - My master, who once again provides valuable
	      assistance with map debugging and feedback.

And Opeth Fans Everywhere...



		      "I am awaiting the sunrise
	       Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
		         Once it came you lied
	        Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops
		          I stand motionless
		     In a parade of falling rain
		       You voice I cannot hear
		        As I am falling again
		           Devotion eludes
		       And in sadness I lumber
	     In my own ashes I am standing without a soul
		  She wept and whispered: "I know..."
		      We walked into the night
		      Am I to bid you farewell?
		    Why can't you see that I try
		       When every tear is shed
			     Is for you?"
