(insert some imaginative garbage here)

Teams start with no defensive structures, but they do have 500 build points and 4 spawns each.

The textures for the bathroom stall wall i created.  Props to me.

the sky is from that terrible city map.

The rest is alllll baseq2 stuff.

I used QERadiant, the mapper of champions.

copywrite.. blah blah.. don't use my crap without the props to me ehh?
